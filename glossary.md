# Glossary

## JavaScript interpreters
A JavaScript interpreter is a program that can read and execute JavaScript code. It takes the JavaScript code as input, parses it, and then executes the instructions it contains.

## High-level
JavaScript is considered a high-level programming language because it uses natural language elements and abstracts away low-level details. This means that developers can write code in a way that is easier to read and understand, without worrying about the underlying hardware or operating system.

## Dynamic
JavaScript is a dynamic programming language, which means that variables can change their data type during runtime. This is in contrast to statically typed languages like C++ or Java, where variables must be explicitly declared with a specific data type and cannot change.

## prototypebased inheritance
In JavaScript, all objects have an internal property called `[[Prototype]] `, If we have a constructor Person and We can add properties and methods to the Person.prototype object, and any object created using the Person constructor function will inherit those properties and methods.

##  Host environment
Both web browsers and Node.js provide an execution environment for JavaScript, but they have different APIs and capabilities. JavaScript developers need to be aware of the differences between these environments when building applications that will run in both contexts.
