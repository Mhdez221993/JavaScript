# Glossary

## JavaScript interpreters
A JavaScript interpreter is a program that can read and execute JavaScript code. It takes the JavaScript code as input, parses it, and then executes the instructions it contains.

* SpiderMonkey by Mozilla
* JavaScriptCore by Apple
* ChakraCore by Microsoft

## High-level
JavaScript is considered a high-level programming language because it uses natural language elements and abstracts away low-level details. This means that developers can write code in a way that is easier to read and understand, without worrying about the underlying hardware or operating system.

## Dynamic
JavaScript is a dynamic programming language, which means that variables can change their data type during runtime. This is in contrast to statically typed languages like C++ or Java, where variables must be explicitly declared with a specific data type and cannot change.

## prototypebased inheritance
In JavaScript, all objects have an internal property called `[[Prototype]] `, If we have a constructor Person and We can add properties and methods to the Person.prototype object, and any object created using the Person constructor function will inherit those properties and methods.

##  Host environment
Both web browsers and Node.js provide an execution environment for JavaScript, but they have different APIs and capabilities. JavaScript developers need to be aware of the differences between these environments when building applications that will run in both contexts.

##  Web browser
A web browser is a software application that enables users to browse and access content on the internet. It communicates with web servers to request and receive web pages and displays the retrieved content to the user for viewing.

## Variables
In JavaScript, a variable is a named container that can hold a value, such as a string, number, boolean, or object.

## Object
An object is a collection of key value pairs and can represent a place, a person, or thing.

## Array
An array is a collection of ordered values, an can contain numbers, string, boolean, objects and others arrays

## Expressions
An expressions is a piece of code that produces a value like a variable a literal or something more complex that produce a value

## Statements
A statement is unit of code that performe and accion like loop, var declaration, if statement, function call

## Control structures
Control structures are programming construct that allow us to control the flow of execution of the program, those inclued loops, conditions, and branching statements

## Function
A function is block of code that is defined onece and cann be invoke over and over. It allows to reuse code.

## Properties withing objecs
An object is collection key value pair, the key is what we call a property name and the value is the property value

## Method
A method is property withing and object, is a function associeted with that object and can be called using dot notation

## Unicode
Is a particular way of encoding a caracter, like letter, number, and so on, It is important for us developer because when you create an app it can support many languagues thank to unicode.

## ASCII
Is also a character encoding standard (American Standard Code Information Interchange)

## Canonical
Refers to the standar for of representing a value, no matter how different they look in code or in the screen if they are equal the should be threated as eqaul that's canonical

## Backward Compativility
Is the ability of new technology to work with older technology, In the case of JavaScript refers to the old code been use with the new code

## Set
Is a build in data structure that I can use to store unique values. has method like `add`, has, `delete`, `clear`, `entries`, `values`, and `forEach`, also `iterators`

## Iterator
Is an object used to access the element of a collection one at a time manually with `next`, `values`, and `done`

## Map
Is a build in object like the object data type, used to store key value pairs in order, it has some build in function like `set`, `get`, `has`, `delete`

## Type Array
Is a special type of array, has fixed length, specific data types, they are usefull for intensive tash like working with audio, images, network protocols

## RegExp
Is a patter that you want to match in a string, is usefull for text searching, validating, replacing (e.g)

## Garbage Collection
Is the process of freen up memory when is not longer used by the program

## IEEE (Institue of Electronical and Electric Engineer)
Is global organization dedicated to advance technologi in many field like computer, science, electronic (e.g)

## Decimal vs Floating-Point numbers
They both refer to a non-interger, deciam have fixed decimal numbers while floating point allow a variable number of decimal numbers

## Compaund Interes
It means that the interes is added to the initial amount, then sum it to calcualte a new amount a so on.
