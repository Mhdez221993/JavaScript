# Glossary

## JavaScript interpreters
A JavaScript interpreter is a program that can read and execute JavaScript code. It takes the JavaScript code as input, parses it, and then executes the instructions it contains.

## High-level
JavaScript is considered a high-level programming language because it uses natural language elements and abstracts away low-level details. This means that developers can write code in a way that is easier to read and understand, without worrying about the underlying hardware or operating system.

## Dynamic
JavaScript is a dynamic programming language, which means that variables can change their data type during runtime. This is in contrast to statically typed languages like C++ or Java, where variables must be explicitly declared with a specific data type and cannot change.

## prototypebased inheritance
In JavaScript, all objects have an internal property called `[[Prototype]] `, If we have a constructor Person and We can add properties and methods to the Person.prototype object, and any object created using the Person constructor function will inherit those properties and methods.

##  Host environment
Both web browsers and Node.js provide an execution environment for JavaScript, but they have different APIs and capabilities. JavaScript developers need to be aware of the differences between these environments when building applications that will run in both contexts.

##  Web browser
A web browser is a software application that enables users to browse and access content on the internet. It communicates with web servers to request and receive web pages and displays the retrieved content to the user for viewing.

## Variables
In JavaScript, a variable is a named container that can hold a value, such as a string, number, boolean, or object.

## Object
An object is a collection of key value pairs and can represent a place, a person, or thing.

## Array
An array is a collection of ordered values, an can contain numbers, string, boolean, objects and others arrays

## Expressions
An expressions is a piece of code that produces a value like a variable a literal or something more complex that produce a value

## Statements
A statement is unit of code that performe and accion like loop, var declaration, if statement, function call

## Control structures
Control structures are programming construct that allow us to control the flow of execution of the program, those inclued loops, conditions, and branching statements

## Function
A function is block of code that is defined onece and cann be invoke over and over. It allows to reuse code.

## Properties withing objecs
An object is collection key value pair, the key is what we call a property name and the value is the property value

## Method
A method is property withing and object, is a function associeted with that object and can be called using dot notation
