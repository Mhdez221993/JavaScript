# JavaScript
Welcome to my JavaScript notes and challenges repository! As I embark on my journey to becoming a better web developer, I will be documenting my progress by taking notes and completing various coding challenges related to JavaScript.

## Strategies for taking effective notes

* Skim the chapter first: This will give you a roadmap for your note-taking process.
* Use a consistent note-taking method: Cornell Method, the Outline Method, or the Mind Mapping Method.
* Write down key concepts and definitions
* Break down complex concepts
* Include code examples and explanations
* Summarize and paraphrase: Instead of copying text verbatim, paraphrase the information in your own words
* Add visual elements: Use diagrams, flowcharts, or other visual aids to represent programming concepts and structures.
* Review and revise: Periodically review and revise your notes
* Create a glossary
* Practice and apply: To reinforce your understanding of the material, practice writing code and working through programming exercises related to the topics covered in the book.

# Introduction
* JavaScript, the most popular programming language, was originally created for the browser, but with Node.js, it has expanded its capabilities beyond the web.
* The browser, the primary host environment for JavaScript, enables developers to receive input from the user via mouse and keyboard events and to output HTML and CSS.
* Another host environment for JavaScript is Node.js, which allows developers to read and write files, send and receive data over the network, and create and serve HTTP requests.
