# JavaScript
Welcome to my JavaScript notes and challenges repository! As I embark on my journey to becoming a better web developer, I will be documenting my progress by taking notes and completing various coding challenges related to JavaScript.

This repository will serve as a central location for me to store and organize my notes and code snippets, as well as a way to track my progress and growth as a developer. Whether you're new to JavaScript or an experienced programmer, I hope my notes and challenges will be a valuable resource to help you further your own skills and knowledge.

So, join me on this journey and let's learn and grow together!
