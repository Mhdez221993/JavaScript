# Lexical Structure
The lexical structure of a programming language is the set of elementary rules that specifies how you write programs in that language like:
* Case sensitivity, spaces, and line breaks
* Comments
* Literals
* Identifiers and reserved words
* Unicode
* Optional semicolons

## The Text of a JavaScript Program
JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. This means that language keywords, variables, function names, and other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters. The `while` keyword, for example, must be typed `“while”` not `“While”` or `“WHILE”` Similarly, `online`, `Online`, `OnLine`, and `ONLINE` are four distinct variable names.

## Comments
JavaScript supports two styles of comments this `//` and this `/* */`
```js
// This is a single-line comment.

/* This is also a comment */ // and here is another comment.

/*
 * This is a multi-line comment. The extra * characters at the start of
 * each line are not a required part of the syntax; they just look cool!
 */
```
