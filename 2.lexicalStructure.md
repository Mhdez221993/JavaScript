For example, the following code snippet uses the \t escape sequence to produce a tab character between the "Name" and "Age" columns
```js
console.log("Name\tAge");
console.log("John\t25");
console.log("Jane\t30");
```
When executed, this code produces the following output in the console:
```bash
Name    Age
John    25
Jane    30
```
