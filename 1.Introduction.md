# Introduction to JavaScript

## High-level language
`JavaScript is considered a high-level language because it is designed to be human-readable and easy to understand, with syntax and structure that is similar to natural language. This is in contrast to low-level languages like assembly language, which is more difficult to read and write and requires a deeper understanding of computer architecture.`

## Dynamic language
`JavaScript is a dynamic language because it does not require explicit data types to be declared before variables are used. Instead, data types are determined automatically at runtime, making it easier to write code quickly and iterate on it more easily.`

## Interpreted language
`JavaScript is an interpreted language, which means that it is executed directly by a browser or other software environment, rather than being compiled into machine code first. This makes it easier to write and test code quickly, since changes can be made and tested in real-time.`

## Object-oriented programming (OOP)
`JavaScript is well-suited to object-oriented programming, which is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and behavior (methods). OOP allows for encapsulation of data and behavior, inheritance of properties and methods, and polymorphism (the ability of objects to take on different forms).`

## Functional programming (FP)
`JavaScript is also well-suited to functional programming, which is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of functions as the primary building blocks of programs. FP emphasizes immutability (data that cannot be changed), pure functions (functions that do not have side effects and always return the same result for a given input), and higher-order functions (functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results).`

## History
`JavaScript (JS) was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while working at Netscape Communications. Initially called Mocha, it was soon renamed to LiveScript and finally to JavaScript. It was designed as a scripting language to add interactivity to web pages, complementing HTML and CSS.

The language gained widespread adoption and evolved through several versions. ECMAScript (ES) became its standardized version, with ES5 and ES6 (also called ES2015) as major milestones. ES6, released in 2015, introduced significant features, such as classes, arrow functions, and promises, shaping modern JavaScript development.`
